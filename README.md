# Color Thief Test

This is just a test application for the plugin Color Thief (https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief).
With this, a user can upload a photo on the browser, and the color thief will take dominant/main colors from the photo.
The colours are then displayed.

This is an javascript version experiment for the [Brank Canvas](https://github.com/hannako/blank_canvas) Project.

With this, the photo and colors can be displayed very quickly without being sent to the backend (Rails).

## Current Status
- unstyled
- It works
